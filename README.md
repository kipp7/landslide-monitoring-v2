Production-minded Windows desktop client for landslide monitoring, field-device supervision, and early-warning workflows.

The repository is intentionally focused: it contains the maintained desktop experience only, with a React/Vite monitoring UI and a native WPF + WebView2 Windows shell. Backend services, mobile apps, deployment infrastructure, internal work logs, and private environment material are deliberately kept out of the public project.

This repository keeps the original project history for traceability. The current public `main` branch is intentionally narrowed to the maintained desktop client; older web, mobile, backend, infrastructure, hardware, and internal research materials remain available only through Git history and are not part of the supported public surface.

## Why This Project

Landslide monitoring workflows often need a dependable operator-facing client: site overview, field device status, GPS deformation trends, alert review, and packaging that can run on Windows machines used by engineering teams. This project provides that desktop layer as a clean, public, and reusable codebase.

## Highlights

- Monitoring workspace for sites, devices, GPS deformation, alerts, account screens, and system status.
- Native Windows shell with WebView2, startup preflight checks, tray support, and packaged static assets.
- Mock-data-first development so UI contributors can run the app without deploying a backend.
- Scripted packaging flow for portable Windows builds and optional installer generation.
- Professional public layout with bilingual documentation, CI, issue templates, security policy, and MIT license.

## Product Surface

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Dashboard | Operator overview for key monitoring sites and system state. |
| Device Management | Device list, command actions, diagnostics, and field status review. |
| GPS Monitoring | GPS deformation views, export paths, and threshold-oriented workflows. |
| Analysis | Visual analysis pages built around charts, maps, and domain mock data. |
| Windows Shell | WPF/WebView2 host for packaging and running the UI as a desktop app. |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop UI | React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Ant Design |
| Visualization | ECharts, Leaflet, Three.js |
| Native shell | .NET 8, WPF, WebView2 |
| Tooling | npm workspaces, ESLint, Prettier, GitHub Actions |

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
- .NET 8 SDK with Windows Desktop support
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime

## Quick Start

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/kipp7/landslide-monitoring-v2.git
cd landslide-monitoring-v2
npm install
npm run dev
```

The UI dev server starts at `http://localhost:5174/`.

Launch the native Windows shell against the dev server:

```powershell
npm run desktop:dev
```

## Build And Package

Build the React desktop UI:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Create the default Windows portable package:

```powershell
npm run desktop:publish
```

Default output:

- `artifacts/windows/portable/`
- `docs/reports/windows-package-latest.json`

## Verification

```powershell
npm audit
npm run lint
npm run build
dotnet build .\apps\windows-shell\LandslideDesk.Win\LandslideDesk.Win.csproj -c Release
```

After packaging:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\desktop\verify-windows-package.ps1
```
